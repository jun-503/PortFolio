# The Evolution of Web Development: From Static Pages to Dynamic Experiences

Web development has come a long way from the days of simple HTML pages. Today, we are creating dynamic, interactive experiences that are more powerful and engaging than ever before.

## The Shift from Static to Dynamic

In the early days of the web, most websites were static, built with basic HTML and CSS. These sites were simple and fast but lacked interactivity. With the advent of JavaScript and server-side technologies, developers began to build dynamic web applications that could respond to user input in real-time.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`
function fetchData() {
  return fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data));
}
`}
</CodeBlock>
